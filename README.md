# ROSACO

**ROSACO** is the color memory game where your brain forgets faster than your eyes blink. Can you remember more than a goldfish? Let’s find out!

## 🧠 What is ROSACO?

ROSACO challenges your memory by showing you a sequence of colors. Your goal: remember and repeat the sequence correctly. Each round, the sequence grows longer. How far can you go before your mind blanks out?

When you lose, ROSACO serves up a roast message—because if you can’t beat the goldfish, at least you can laugh about it.

## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Start the game** and watch the color sequence.
2. **Repeat the sequence** by clicking/tapping the colors in the correct order.
3. **Advance to the next round** if you’re right—the sequence gets longer!
4. **Game Over?** Get roasted. The game will display a fun roast message based on your performance.

Example roast messages:
- “Ouch! Even a goldfish would remember that!”
- “Blink and you missed it. Try again, memory champ!”
- “Your memory just crashed harder than my code on a Monday.”
- “Did you forget the colors or the rules?”
